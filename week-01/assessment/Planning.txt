Implementation for Capsule Hotel

*** main ***
Declare viarables
Get input for the hotel capacity
Represent our capsules by a single string array
4 options - check in, check out, view list, exit
While option 4 (exit) is not selected
    Get input for selected option
    Switch between each option
        Check In: run function
        Check Out: run function
        View List: run function
        Exit: exit application
*** main ***

*** Check In ***
Params: (String[])
Declare local variables
Get input for the capsule we want to place in
Confirm that it is an open room
    if it is an invalid # or string, do not go
    if there is someone occupying it, do not go
Otherwise, welcome the guest and bring them into the String[]
*** Check In ***

*** Check Out ***
Params: (String[])
Declare local variables
Get input for the capsule we want to leave
Confirm that it is a taken room
    if it is an invalid # or string, do not go
    if there is nobody occupying it, do not go
Otherwise, thank the guest and take them out of the String[]
*** Check Out ***

*** NOTE: The Check In and Check Out functions are going to act very similarly ***

*** View List ***
Params: (String[])
Declare local variables
    if it is < 11 capsules, then don't even ask for a capsule to check
    else, we get input for the capsule we want to view
        if it is 5 less than either end of the array, print onto the other half for 11 total
        for example, if I ask for capsule 2, it will print 1-11
Confirm that it is valid
    if it is an invalid # or string, do not go
Run a for loop printing all of the rooms, simply use the String[] for the names
